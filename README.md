**GETTING STARTED**

There are several ways to mod but my prefered method is with .mpq files so I will focus on that method alone.

**Step: 1:** Get a copy of CascView and extract the game files. [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/pv8pot/d2r_modding_guide/) [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZTTq7MXZ5w) At time 1 minute 55 seconds.

**Step 2:** Get a copy of Ladik's MPQ Editor.

There are a few versions of it and some are much better than others.

Version 4.0.0.871 (Unicode Build) that uses StormLib v 9.23 works well for me.
